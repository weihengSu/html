Gladys and Harold Beebe<br>
Alexandria, Louisiana<br>
Ages 81 and 87<br>
Married 62 years, with three children, six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren<br>

<br>
Gladys: In 1948, when I was a high school senior, my girlfriend asked me to go with her and some other folks on a triple date. I told her, “I don’t go on blind dates.” Then she showed me a picture of Harold and I changed my mind. He was a college fella and so handsome!

On the evening we all planned to go to the movies, I was very excited. Harold came to the door to get me. But when we got to the car, where two other boys and two young ladies were waiting, Harold sat down and put his arm around another girl! I had to spend the evening with some other boy, who was full of himself. I did not have fun on that date.
<br>
Harold: I can’t remember why I chose another girl to be with that night, but, boy, I knew I had messed up. Bee—that’s what everyone calls Gladys—was very cute. She talked a lot and got along with everyone. After that evening, I called her three times and asked her out, but she kept turning me down. So I finally bluffed her out. I said, “If you don’t say yes, I’m not calling you anymore.”
<br>
Gladys: I agreed to go with him on a date, but only because I wanted to punish him for messing up and not choosing me that first night. My plan was to spend the evening being totally indifferent.
<br>
Harold: Thankfully, she changed her mind.
<br>
Gladys: We went to a drive-in movie, then had po’boys and curlicue potatoes afterward. I saw that Harold was smart and very kind. And he had a red convertible. That was big stuff back then. After a few dates, it grew into true love.
<br>
Harold: Two years later, in 1950, when I was 25 and Bee was 20, we went to the local courthouse and got married. But we kept it a secret, because Bee’s parents thought that she was too young.
<br>
Gladys: I was living at home and going to business school while Harold was studying to become a dentist. I hid the marriage certificate in my bedroom. Two weeks later, my mother found it when she was cleaning my room. Shocked, she called the justice of the peace and asked him, “Did you marry my daughter?” My parents came around, though. They liked Harold. He’s a good fella.
<br>
Harold: I learned early on to always ask Gladys what she would rather do. That’s one secret to our marriage: I don’t pretend to be a know-it-all.
<br>
Gladys: Harold has always put me first. After we got married, he wouldn’t go golfing at the country club with the other men. He would play with me. I love that about him.
<br>
Harold: Gladys has brought out the best in me by giving me unconditional support.
<br>
Gladys: Harold and I still enjoy each other’s company more than anyone else’s. We can’t play golf anymore, but we like to watch tournaments together on TV. And we’ve always been big Louisiana State University football fans, so we never miss a game. Oh sure, we still get mad at each other, but we try not to get mad at the same time.
<br>
Harold: There’s not enough love in this world, so you can’t lose when you meet someone like Bee. I am very lucky. </p>


<p class="stories"><br>
Renata Pasqualini and Wadih Arap
<br>Houston
<br>Ages 46 and 52
<br>Married 18 years

<br>
Wadih: Renata and I grew up in the same city in Brazil. We attended the same elementary and high schools and later shared an adviser at the University of São Paulo. But because of our six-year age difference, we never crossed paths.
<br>
Renata: We also shared a commitment to finding a cure for cancer. After graduation from medical school, Wadih studied cancer biology at Stanford University, and I did postdoctoral research at Harvard University.
<br>
Wadih: In June 1993, I needed a hard-to-find chemical for a particular experiment. My college adviser back in Brazil suggested I contact Renata in Boston, since she was using the same element in her work.
<br>
Renata: Wadih called me from his office in San Diego. Then we began corresponding by e-mail, which was brand-new back then.
<br>
Wadih: Forty-four people in my lab had to share the same e-mail address.
<br>
Renata: At first, our messages were purely professional. Then we began getting more philosophical and having deeper exchanges. But neither of us had romantic expectations.
<br>
Wadih: In August I invited Renata to speak about her research to my lab associates. When she stepped through the airport gate, I thought, Uh-oh, I’m in trouble.
<br>
Renata: I didn’t think that. But Wadih was exceedingly charming.
<br>
Wadih: She gave her lecture the next day, a Thursday. On Friday I took her to a classy restaurant. I couldn’t stop thinking this was it, that we would never see each other again. So I said, “I think we should get married.”
<br>
Renata: He put his hand in mine and something incredible happened. I knew I was in love. I said yes.
<br>
Wadih: We hadn’t even kissed yet.
<br>
Renata: Oh no! And there was no alcohol involved, either. My parents and friends were stunned when I told them I was engaged. I’m not known to be impulsive.
<br>
Wadih: We were both busy with work, but two months later we met up in Reno and married at an all-night chapel. We had a one-day honeymoon in Lake Tahoe.
<br>
Renata: I didn’t move in with Wadih for six months, because I had experiments to finish. We phoned, e-mailed, and saw each other when we could.
<br>
Wadih: Then, in 1999, we accepted an offer to head up our own research laboratory at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.
<br>
Renata: Now we spend 98 percent of our time together. We work side by side.
<br>
Wadih: For some couples, our situation would be a deal breaker. They might think, If I worked by myself, I would get all the glory and awards.
<br>
Renata: Sometimes we fight like the gods. But minutes later it’s forgotten. Wadih and I are equals in every way. And we have a palpable connection. To this day, I wonder, What if I had been careful and turned down his proposal? It’s a dreadful thought.

<p class="stories">
<br>Deborah and Carlo Pann
<br>Burbank, California
<br>Ages 57 and 59
<br>Married 26 years, with two sons, ages 23 and 22
<br>

Carlo: In the fall of 1978, I was selected to be a contestant on Jeopardy! When I walked into the greenroom, a dozen other players were also waiting.
<br>
Deborah: I was one of the few women there. I had just killed it on my trial show, where they determine if you can go on the real program. I remember one of my clues had been “Longest song title of ASCAP record.” The answer was “How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Loved You When You Know I’ve Been a Liar All My Life?” I was telling the other contestants that I was only the second person in the show’s history to answer that correctly when this tall, skinny man with curly hair and a terrible brown suit put his hand out for me to shake and said, “I was the first.”
<br>
Carlo: Deb had these great, bright eyes with such a vitality behind them.
<br>
Deborah: Carlo kept butting in to the conversation. He had something to say about everything. And yet we ended up flirting with each other.
<br>
Carlo: I didn’t have a problem with self-confidence back then.
<br>
Deborah: A network representative from standards and practices noticed that we were flirting, and she wouldn’t allow us to participate on the same show.
<br>
Carlo: I had already won on the show, but the next taping day I went on and lost. Before I left, I gave Deb my phone number.
<br>
Deborah: I didn’t think much about it because it was finally my turn to compete. I did terribly.
<br>
Carlo: I watched the episode at home. I remember yelling at the screen, “Come on! You know that!” I knew how smart she was.
<br>
Deborah: Three weeks later, I called Carlo (we both lived in the L.A. area). He had mentioned he worked at a movie theater and I thought, Hey, free movies! We spent our first date prowling around old book and record stores. I was surprised that we shared so many interests: We both liked the Andrews Sisters as much as Pink Floyd.
<br>
Carlo: I was smitten. We began dating and married in 1985.
<br>
Deborah: We’ve had our ups and downs. In 2007 I was laid off from my managerial position. Then we lost our home to foreclosure. I thought, We’re smart! How did we sign up for such a lousy mortgage? We’re now in a two-bedroom apartment. Carlo is a freelance writer, and I’m working as a receptionist. There has been a lot of yelling, but a lot of back rubs as well.
<br>
Carlo: We hold each other to high standards. God help you if you tell a joke you’ve told before. And when we watch Jeopardy!, we both try to guess the response from the final-category name instead of waiting for the clue.
<br>
Deborah: Through the years, we have kept each other interesting and interested.
<br>
Carlo: I would like to think I know everything there is about Deb, but I don’t. She’s always giving me new things to learn, and I love her for that.
